The goal of this project is to learn how to build GNOME software throught fun and interesting topics such as cyber security.

The encryption techniques used in this version are *OBSOLETE* so be careful out there and dont try anything stupid! 

## Having fun

Then you will have a blast messing around with the file `sketch1.glade`.
Have fun!

Keep in mind that this a student project and the gaol is to learn how to build open source sofware, but feel free to contribute any way chape or form. The main file is `main.c` please keep the naming of files as they are.
Compiling :
```bash
$ gcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` -o cryptech main.c `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`
