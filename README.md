## Notes

*Please don't forget that this is still work in progress and that bugs can lead to complete loss of selected files.*

The goal of this project is to learn how to build GNOME software throught fun and interesting topics such as cyber security.

The encryption techniques used in this version are *OBSOLETE* so be careful out there and dont try anything stupid! 

## Having fun 
If your sole purpose in life is destroying the hard work done by large teams of devs such as no oneâ€¦
Then you will have a blast messing around with the file [`interface.ui`](./interface.ui) or [main.c](./main.c), at the heart of the app.
Have fun!
